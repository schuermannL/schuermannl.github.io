Hi, I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [_Center for Civil Society Research_](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/center-for-civil-society-research) at WZB Berlin Social Science Center, where I am part of the WZB ProtestMonitoring, a research project on protest and political radicalization in Germany. From January to June 2025, I will be WZB Harvard Merit Fellow/Visiting Scholar at Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies at [Harvard University](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu).

Previously, I was a PhD Candidate at the Cologne Center for Comparative Politics at [University of Cologne](https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/en/). I have also been a visiting researcher at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en), and [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu) in Barcelona. 

My research interests are protest, social movements, political participation, political representation, electoral systems and computational social sciences. In my PhD thesis, I studied [Political Representation and Protest Politics in European Democracies]({{< relref "/protest_representation" >}}). I apply a variety of methods with special focus on computational text analysis tools and survey experiments.

My work appeared in the [_British Journal of Political Science_](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123423000169), [_European Journal of Political Research_](https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12704), [_Electoral Studies_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2022.102575), [_Legislative Studies Quarterly_](https://doi.org/10.1111/lsq.12379), and the [_Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties_](https://doi.org/10.1080/17457289.2023.2189729). 

I am engaged in public debates on the political effects of protests and have contributed expert opions to [_Tagesschau_](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gesellschaft/fridays-for-future-244.html) (ARD) [_Quarks_](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxmf-IHKDoX/) (WDR), [_taz-die tageszeitung_](https://taz.de/Klimastreik-von-Fridays-und-Verdi/!5995664/), and [_Frankfurter Rundschau_](https://www.fr.de/politik/verdi-und-fridays-for-future-warnstreiks-in-mehr-als-70-staedten-92865052.html) among others.
