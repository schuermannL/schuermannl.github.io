Hi, I am a doctoral researcher at the _Cologne Center for Comparative Politics_. My research interests include protest, social movements, political participation, political representation, European Politics and computational social sciences. 

In my PhD thesis, I study the [Political Representation of Protest in European Democracies]({{< ref "/project/protest_representation" >}} "About Us"). To that end, I apply a variety of methods with a special focus on computational text analysis tools.
