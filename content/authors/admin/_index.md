Hi, I am a political scientist working on the intersection of comparative politics and political sociology. Currently, I work as a Max Weber Fellow at [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/home) and as PRIME Fellow at the [Freie Universität Berlin](https://www.polsoz.fu-berlin.de/en/soziologie/arbeitsbereiche/politische-soziologie/team/wimi/lennart-schuermann.html)/[WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en/persons/lennart-schurmann).

Previously, I was Post-Doctoral Fellow at the *Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies*, [Harvard University](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/lennart-schuermann) and at the *Center for Civil Society Research*, [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en/persons/lennart-schurmann). I did my PhD at the *Cologne Center for Comparative Politics*, [University of Cologne](https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/en/). During my PhD, I have also been a visiting researcher at *University of Amsterdam*, *WZB Berlin Social Science Center*, and *Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona*. 

My research interests include protest, social movements, political participation, political representation, electoral systems, European politics and computational social sciences. In my PhD thesis, I studied [Political Representation and Protest Politics in European Democracies]({{< relref "/protest_representation" >}}). I apply a variety of methods with special focus on computational text analysis tools and survey experiments. In my new project, [Voices Beyond Ballots]({{< relref "/voices_beyond_ballots" >}}), I will develop, among other innovations, new tools for the automated analysis of protest event videos.

My work appeared in the [_British Journal of Political Science_](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123423000169), [_European Journal of Political Research_](https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12704), [_Electoral Studies_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2022.102575), [_Legislative Studies Quarterly_](https://doi.org/10.1111/lsq.12379), [_Social Movement Studies_](https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2025.2530410) and the [_Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties_](https://doi.org/10.1080/17457289.2023.2189729) among others. I am engaged in public debates on the political effects of protests and have contributed expert opinions for example to [_Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/bundestagswahl/anti-afd-so-stark-beeinflussen-demonstrationen-die-wahlen-110302282.html),  [_Tagesschau_](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/bundestagswahl/anti-afd-so-stark-beeinflussen-demonstrationen-die-wahlen-110302282.html) (ARD), [_taz-die tageszeitung_](https://taz.de/Klimastreik-von-Fridays-und-Verdi/!5995664/), and [_Frankfurter Rundschau_](https://www.fr.de/politik/verdi-und-fridays-for-future-warnstreiks-in-mehr-als-70-staedten-92865052.html).
