Hi, I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies at [Harvard University](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/lennart-schuermann) and at the Center for Civil Society Research at [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en/persons/lennart-schurmann). During the academic year 2025-26, I will be a [DAAD PRIME Fellow](https://www.daad.de/en/studying-in-germany/scholarships/daad-funding-programmes/prime/prime-fellows-202324/) at Freie Universität Berlin and a Max Weber Fellow at the European University Institute.

Previously, I was a PhD Candidate at the Cologne Center for Comparative Politics at [University of Cologne](https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/en/). During my PhD, I have also been a visiting researcher at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en), [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en), and [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu) in Barcelona. 

My research interests include protest, social movements, political participation, political representation, electoral systems, European politics and computational social sciences. In my PhD thesis, I studied [Political Representation and Protest Politics in European Democracies]({{< relref "/protest_representation" >}}). I apply a variety of methods with special focus on computational text analysis tools and survey experiments. In my new project, [Voices Beyond Ballots]({{< relref "/voices_beyond_ballots" >}}), I will develop, among other innovations, new tools for the automated analysis of protest event videos.

My work appeared in the [_British Journal of Political Science_](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123423000169), [_European Journal of Political Research_](https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.12704), [_Electoral Studies_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2022.102575), [_Legislative Studies Quarterly_](https://doi.org/10.1111/lsq.12379), and the [_Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties_](https://doi.org/10.1080/17457289.2023.2189729) among others. 

I am engaged in public debates on the political effects of protests and have contributed expert opinions for example to [_Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/bundestagswahl/anti-afd-so-stark-beeinflussen-demonstrationen-die-wahlen-110302282.html),  [_Tagesschau_](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/bundestagswahl/anti-afd-so-stark-beeinflussen-demonstrationen-die-wahlen-110302282.html) (ARD) [_Quarks_](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxmf-IHKDoX/) (WDR), [_taz-die tageszeitung_](https://taz.de/Klimastreik-von-Fridays-und-Verdi/!5995664/), and [_Frankfurter Rundschau_](https://www.fr.de/politik/verdi-und-fridays-for-future-warnstreiks-in-mehr-als-70-staedten-92865052.html).
