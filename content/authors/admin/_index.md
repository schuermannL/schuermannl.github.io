Hi, I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the [_Center for Civil Society Research_](https://www.wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/center-for-civil-society-research) at WZB Berlin Social Science Center. Previously, I was a PhD Candidate at the [_Cologne Center for Comparative Politics_](https://cccp.uni-koeln.de/en/) at University of Cologne. I have also been a visiting researcher at [_University of Amsterdam_](https://www.uva.nl/en), [_WZB Berlin Social Science Center_](https://www.wzb.eu/en), and [_Pompeu Fabra University_](https://www.upf.edu) in Barcelona.  

My research interests include protest, social movements, political participation, political representation, electoral systems and computational social sciences. In my PhD thesis, I studied the [Political Representation and Protest Politics in European Democracies]({{< relref "/protest_representation" >}}). To that end, I applied a variety of methods with a special focus on computational text analysis tools.

My work appeared in the _British Journal of Political Science_, _Electoral Studies_, _Legislative Studies Quarterly_, and the _Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties_. I am engaged in public debates on protest behavior and have contributed expert opions to [_Tagesschau_](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/gesellschaft/fridays-for-future-244.html) (ARD), and [_Quarks_](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cxmf-IHKDoX/) (WDR), among others.
