MPs are elected as delegates of their electoral district to represent their constituents' interests. Successful geographical representation on higher legislative levels is considered to be a central quality indicator for legislative systems. This project builds upon my Master's Thesis, in which I studied the strategic incentives for geographical representation in the German mixed-member electoral system.
