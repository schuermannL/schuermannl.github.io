Our study asks why large-scale protests, widely anticipated during Germany’s ‘Hot Autumn’ of 2022, did not materialize despite a severe cost-of-living crisis. Drawing on insights from social movement studies, we test the long-standing argument that successful mobilization depends on the presence of mobilizing agents that align programmatically with existing demand. We use an innovative multi-method design that combines individual-level survey data with protest event analysis to examine both protest potential and actual mobilization. The survey includes a conjoint experiment to identify factors influencing protest potential. Our findings show that despite strong public sympathy, the ‘Hot Autumn’ saw only moderate protest participation, as established trade unions and political parties from both the left and the right struggled to capitalize on the momentum. Instead, the left-nationalist Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) emerged as a new challenger, offering an economically left-wing, culturally nationalist platform that resonated with protest sympathizers. By analyzing how ideological (mis)alignment shapes protest dynamics, our study contributes to research on party-movement interactions and demonstrates how the two-dimensional structure of political conflict increasingly challenges traditional left-wing actors’ ability to mobilize.","tags":[],"title":"Protest and the rise of left-nationalist challengers: evidence from Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lennart Schürmann","Jan Schwalbach","Noam Himmelrath"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1748131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1748131200,"objectID":"b13be87c8bc0dcedd5db2487f7328a59","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/ejpr_2024/","publishdate":"2025-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ejpr_2024/","section":"publication","summary":"In liberal democracies, protest can serve as a trigger for necessary policy reforms, but it can also be used by a loud minority to advance political goals against the will of the majority. Focusing on such vocal protests in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we investigate the following question. How does the location of protest events affect the likelihood of political engagement with the protests in a multilevel system? Combining social movement literature with studies of issue attention and rhetorical responsiveness, we analyze how German members of parliaments’ (MPs) responses vary using their tweets from the onset of the pandemic to the German federal election in September 2021. Using quantitative text analysis, we measure rhetorical responsiveness to Covid-19 protests and apply multilevel regression analyses and difference-in-differences. We find that more protests lead to more attention; however, MPs respond most strongly to protests within the state they represent. Furthermore, politicians’ level within the German multilevel system affects their attention to these protests, with MPs elected at lower levels of an electoral system responding more to local protest events than MPs elected at higher levels. The results highlight the importance of the location of protests in attracting political attention.","tags":[],"title":"Location matters!

This research  examines the effect of such mobilization on voting behavior in subsequent national and  European elections. We focus on two periods of anti-racist demonstra-tions in Germany  that followed 1) the killing of nine people in the 2020 Hanau racist terrorist attack and 2)  the uncovering of a racist mass deportation plan by far-right actors, including some  Alternative for Germany (AfD) politicians in 2024. The study hypothesizes that local antiracist protests lead to less anti-migration, i.e., far-right AfD voting, and more promigration, i.e., Green voting. Empirically, we connect protest data with aggregate voting  data from German state offices. Using difference-in-differences (DID) and entropy  balancing, we show that local anti-racist protests can indeed influence voting behavior  toward a more inclusive society. We find the hypothesized effect in the 2021 federal  elections for both parties. However, in the European elections, we only find negative  effects on AfD vote share. The Green Party only benefited from anti-racist protests in 2021,  when they held a clear pro-migration stance and were part of the opposition.","tags":[],"title":"How anti-racist protests influence pro- and anti-migration voting behavior: Evidence from national and European elections","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Many diagnose that representative democracy is in a state of crisis, with an increasing alienation between citizens and elected representatives. In this crisis of representation, other political actors, such as protest activists, enter the stage and increasingly claim to represent either parts of the electorate or subjects without formal representation. One example are the environmentalist activists from the Last Generation who declared to speak on behalf of both the entire humanity and nature. Another example is the xenophobic movement PEGIDA, who publicly stated they speak for the entire ’German people.’ Such actors have no official electoral mandate and selfauthorize their representative claims. Voices-Beyond-Ballots will extend established theories of political representation and employ innovative empirical approaches to (1) identify the circumstances under which these self- authorized political actors use such representative claims, (2) elucidate how self-authorized and elected actors use representative claims differently, (3) and analyze the factors influencing citizens’ receptivity to these claims.\nI expect non-elected actors to increasingly use representative claims, particularly to speak for those who have no other voice in politics. Furthermore, I expect that people do actually accept such claims from non-elected actors, yet more if they refer to people (e.g. future generations) or subjects (e.g. nature) that have no formal representation in politics. At the same time, such claims-making might also undermine people’s beliefs in representative claims by elected officials. Whether this development is good or bad news for representative democracy, as we know, remains thus an open question that Voices-Beyond-Ballots will further illuminate.\nTo fully understand these dynamics, we currently lack systematic and rich data on representative claims by non- elected political actors. Therefore a key ambition of Voices-Beyond-Ballots is to provide unique data of representative claims by protest activists based on video-enhanced protest event data from German protests from the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008 until 2023. This dataset combines classical protest event analysis with video and text data of the speeches made at protest events. In a second step Voices-Beyond-Ballots analyzes the citizens’ receptivity to these claims. To measure them, Voices-Beyond-Ballots will use survey experiments in which citizens are presented with varying representative claims by non-elected and elected actors to measure how citizens perceive these claims. All collected data will be made publicly available.\nOverall, Voices-Beyond-Ballots offers ground-breaking combinations of the supply side (what protest actors say) and the demand side (how citizens receive) of representative claims by non-elected actors, and thus builds bridges between political representation, social movement and communication research. By surpassing the traditional politician-citizen paradigm, the project’s outcomes promise to enhance our comprehension of non-electoral representation in democracies.\nVoices-Beyond-Ballots is funded through the WZB Harvard Merit Fellowship 2025/26 and a DAAD PRIME Grant. The research project will run from January 2025 until December 2026 and will be conducted at Harvard University, the European University Institute, the Free University of Berlin, and the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.\n","date":1736899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1736899200,"objectID":"8c97b89fe6787895dbfdafc8f19e3056","permalink":"https://example.com/project/voices_beyond_ballots/","publishdate":"2025-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/voices_beyond_ballots/","section":"project","summary":"Many diagnose that representative democracy is in a state of crisis, with an increasing alienation between citizens and elected representatives.

In this paper, I examine the reactions of politicians to this movement to answer the research question: To what extent have German Members of Parliament (MPs) been responsive to local environmentalist street protests by focusing their attention on the Climate Strike Movement and Environmental Policy? To this end, I apply dictionary-based quantitative text-analytical tools to study German MPs’ political communication through 292,949 Facebook posts and 43,644 parliamentary debates between September 2017 and February 2020. Focussing on the effect of the first global climate strike in March 2019 and leveraging varying protest frequencies between the electoral districts, I show that MPs are responsive to protest events in their districts. More local street protest events in an electoral district led to more attention to the Climate Strike Movement and Environmental Policies by political representatives associated with that district. Comparing different discursive arenas, I show how politicians adjust their communication according to the arena’s audience, with protests affecting the political attention to environmental policies more in parliamentary debates than on social media.","tags":[],"title":"The impact of local protests on political elite communication: evidence from Fridays for Future in Germany","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno Castanho Silva","Lennart Schürmann","Sven-Oliver Proksch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1712793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1712793600,"objectID":"0d9cf096ea6e7318469233fc7319e647","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/bjpols_2023/","publishdate":"2024-04-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bjpols_2023/","section":"publication","summary":"It is well known that politicians speak differently when campaigning.

On an ongoing basis, we analyse the temporal and spatial contexts of protest events, the discursive opportunity structures of protest, as well as the radicalisation processes of individual protest actors.\nMethodologically, our project is based on a comprehensive data collection, which comprises three closely related collection instruments: First, we systematically analyse protest events since the 1950s (including form of protest, place, time, number of participants and issues). This is retrospectively linked to the Prodat dataset. Second, we examine public debates in the context of protest events and political violence, as well as long-term dynamics of radicalisation in the public sphere. Third, we analyse the profiles of radical protest actors and their socio-structural characteristics. Empirically, the project combines automated and manual methods of quantitative content analysis based on media coverage in national and regional newspapers as well as biographical and social network data.\nThe project is part of the top research cluster Monitoring System and Transfer Platform Radicalization (MOTRA), a project funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the Federal Ministry of the Interior in the context of civil security research.

Street mobilization constitutes an integral part of political participation in representative democracies nowadays. Yet, to what extent can protests influence politics in representative democracies? And which political actors represent the interests of these protests?\nMy dissertation explores these questions by examining protests and their representation in European democracies in an empirical-analytical way. My dissertation topic is thus situated at the intersection of social movement and representative democracy literature. It consists of four interrelated individual projects that make theoretical contributions and methodological innovations in the research area of the political representation of protest.\nThe main focus of my dissertation lies in the interaction between civil society actors (with a particular focus on protest movements) and political actors of the representative-electoral systems (with a specific emphasis on parties and MPs). Historically, political representation is geographically bound as representatives are elected in territorial districts with the right to vote defined by geographical borders. In European democracies, this centuries ago established system is still in place nowadays, albeit in certain varieties with several adjustments. Even in more flexible electoral systems, the geographic borders of the districts define who can vote and who is excluded from voting rights. Political representation is therefore per definition restricted to territorial communities and thus defined by borders. However, civil society increasingly organizes transnationally in the European context, thus transcending national and administrative borders.\nTo answer the research questions of my dissertation project, I use a mixed-method approach combining well-established techniques such as regression analyses and semi-structured interviews with cutting-edge machine-learning methods such as synthetic controls and topic modeling to process big data. A particular focus of my dissertation lies in the analysis of political texts. One data source I use is online political communication on social media, offering the opportunity to access politicians’ political communication at the individual level in an unmediated channel. Arguably, MPs’ most relevant public communicative action occurs in parliamentary debates, which is why I also analyze political communication in parliaments. The methodological triangulation in my mixed-method approach allows me to take advantage of the benefits of processing large amounts of data while still obtaining theoretically-driven valid results.\nMy results indicate that individual politicians and political parties are more responsive to protest events within the borders of their electoral districts. Comparing different levels of the European multilevel system, I can show that the protest location is most influential for legislators on subnational levels. Beyond that, my findings underline the importance of politicians’ biographies, which are, besides party ideological and strategic consideration, crucial to explain their responsiveness to political protests.\nI received funding for this project from the Cologne Graduate School in Management, Economics and Social Sciences (CGS) at the University of Cologne, the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service), and the Schmittmann-Wahlen Foundation.
